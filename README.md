# Itachi Uchiha

## Summary

I created a webpage dedicated to [Itachi Uchiha] (https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Itachi_Uchiha?so=search), a complex and honorable character from Naruto, as a practice project to refine my HTML and CSS skills.

- Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a lightweight and responsive experience
- Custom animations using keyframes
- Responsive tables that adapt dynamically to screen size
- Customized link colors for visited and unvisited states

## Setup

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

### 1. Fork the Repository

First, you need to fork this repository to your GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button near the top right of this page. If you are unfamiliar with this process, please follow this GitHub [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo).

### 2. Clone the Repository

Next, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command. Make sure to replace `your-username` with your GitHub username:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/itachi-uchiha
```

### 3. Running the File

Once cloned, navigate to your project folder, locate the HTML file, and double-click it. This should open the file in your default browser.
